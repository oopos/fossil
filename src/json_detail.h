/*
** Signature for JSON page/command callbacks. Each callback is
** responsible for handling one JSON request/command and/or
** dispatching to sub-commands.
**
** By the time the callback is called, json_page_top() (HTTP mode) or
** json_cmd_top() (CLI mode) will have set up the JSON-related
** environment. Implementations may generate a "result payload" of any
** JSON type by returning its value from this function (ownership is
** tranferred to the caller). On error they should set
** g.json.resultCode to one of the FossilJsonCodes values and return
** either their payload object or NULL. Note that NULL is a legal
** success value - it simply means the response will contain no
** payload. If g.json.resultCode is non-zero when this function
** returns then the top-level dispatcher will destroy any payload
** returned by this function and will output a JSON error response
** instead.
**
** All of the setup/response code is handled by the top dispatcher
** functions and the callbacks concern themselves only with:
**
** a) Permissions checking (inspecting g.perm).
** b) generating a response payload (if applicable)
** c) Setting g.json's error state (if applicable). See json_set_err().
**
** It is imperitive that NO callback functions EVER output ANYTHING to
** stdout, as that will effectively corrupt any JSON output, and
** almost certainly will corrupt any HTTP response headers. Output
** sent to stderr ends up in my apache log, so that might be useful
** for debuggering in some cases, but no such code should be left
** enabled for non-debuggering builds.
