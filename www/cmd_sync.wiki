<h2>sync</h2>

The <code>sync</code> command [./cmd_pull.wiki | <code>pull</code>]s and
[./cmd_push.wiki | <code>push</code>]es repository changes simultaneously.

This applies to repositories available via a URL, of course.  If your
project is strictly local you can do all of the distributed stuff as
long as you are "serving" the repository via http in some fashion, but
it's probably pointless to do so.

Assuming you aren't running <b>fossil</b> as a high-powered version of
[http://www.gnu.org/software/rcs | RCS], your use of <code>sync</code>
in your projects is up to you.  <b>fossil</b> defaults to using a
[./cmd_setting.wiki | setting] of <code>autosync</code>
If you have cloned a repository you will automatically sync with the
original if you [./cmd_commit.wiki | commit] changes to your local
version <em>unless</em> you customize your configuration.
