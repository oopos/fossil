<h2>update</h2>

What do you do if you have changes out on a repository and
you want them merged with your checkout?

You use the <code>update</code> command.

<b>fossil</b> can [./about_checkout.wiki | overwrite] any
changes you've made to your checkout, or it can
[./about_merge.wiki | merge] whatever changes have occurred
in the repo into your checkout.

Update <em>merges</em> changes from the repository into your checkout.

<b>fossil</b> uses a simple conflict resolution strategy for merges:
the latest change wins.

Local intranet <code>[./cmd_commit.wiki | commit]</code>s
(by someone else)
or Net <code>[./cmd_pull.wiki | pull]</code>s from a server
will usually require a <code>fossil&nbsp;update</code> afterward.

Local commits are likely to be made with
[./cmd_settings.wiki#autosync | automatic syncing]
set to "on", however, so if you don't use <b>fossil</b> for Net-wide
projects you may never have to use <code>update</code>.
