<h2>new</h2>

The <code>new</code> command allows you to create a brand new
repository.

Pragmatically, this means that an SQLite database is created with
whatever name you specified, and set up with the appropriate tables
and initial data.

There's not much to <code>new</code>, it's what happens afterward that
gets a project going:

  Once you have a new repository file, you need to create and cd to a
  directory in which you will store your files, or move into an
  existing directory which contains the files for a project.

  Then, you need to [./cmd_open.wiki | <code>open</code>] the new
  repository, and get the server running so you can set up the project
  name and so forth.

  Finally, you'll [./cmd_add.wiki | <code>add</code>] files to it.  If
  you are adding exisiting files, you can add them individually, via
  globbing from the shell, or by adding the directory (which will add
  all of the directory's file-system descendants recursively.)

But you can't do all that until you create a repository file with
<code>new</code>.
