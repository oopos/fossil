<title>Building and Installing Fossil</title>

<h2>0.0 Using A Pre-compiled Binary</h2>

<p>Released versions of fossil come with
<a href="http://www.fossil-scm.org/download.html">pre-compiled binaries and
a source archive</a> for that release. You can thus skip the following if you
want to run or build a release version of fossil. Just download
the appropriate package from the <a href="http://www.fossil-scm.org/download.html">downloads page</a>
and put it on your $PATH.
To uninstall, simply delete the binary.
To upgrade from an older release, just overwrite the older binary with
the newer one.</p>

<h2>0.1 Executive Summary</h2>

<p>Building and installing is very simple.  Three steps:</p>

<ol>
<li> Download and unpack a source tarball or ZIP.
<li> <b>./configure; make</b>
<li> Move or copy the resulting "fossil" executable to someplace
     on your $PATH.
</ol>

<h2>1.0 Obtaining The Source Code</h2>

<p>Fossil is self-hosting, so you can obtain a ZIP archive containing
a snapshot of the <em>latest</em> version directly from fossil's own fossil
repository. Additionally, source archives of <em>released</em> versions of
fossil are available from the <a href="http://www.fossil-scm.org/download.html">downloads page</a>.
To obtain a development version of fossil, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Point your web browser at
<a href="http://www.fossil-scm.org/">
http://www.fossil-scm.org/</a>.  Click on the "Login" menu button.</p></li>

<li><p>Log in as anonymous.  The password is shown on screen.
The reason for requiring this login is to prevent spiders from
walking the entire website, downloading ZIP archives
of every historical version, and thereby soaking up all our bandwidth.</p></li>

<li><p>Click on the 
<a href="http://www.fossil-scm.org/fossil/timeline">Timeline</a> 
link at the top of the page.</p></li>

<li><p>Select a version of of fossil you want to download.  Click on its
link.  Note that you must successfully log in as "anonymous" in step 1
above in order to see the link to the detailed version information.</p></li>

<li><p>Finally, click on one of the
"Zip Archive" or "Tarball" links, according to your preference.
These link will build a ZIP archive or a gzip-compressed tarball of the 
complete source code and download it to your browser.
</ol>

<h2>2.0 Compiling</h2>

<ol>
<li value="6">
<p>Unpack the ZIP or tarball you downloaded into that directory then
<b>cd</b> into the directory created.</p></li>

<li><i>(Optional, unix only)</i>
Run <b>./configure</b> to construct a makefile.

<ol type="a">
<li><p>
If you do not have the OpenSSL library installed on your system, then
add <b>--with-openssl=none</b> to omit the https functionality.

<li><p>
To build a statically linked binary (suitable for use inside a chroot
jail) add the <b>--static</b> option.

<li><p>
Other configuration options can be seen by running
<b>./configure --help</b>
</ol>

<li><p>Run make to build the "fossil" or "fossil.exe" executable.  The
details depend on your platform and compiler.

<ol type="a">
<li><p><i>Unix</i> &rarr; the configure-generated Makefile should work on
all unix and unix-like systems.  Simply type "<b>make</b>".

<li><p><i>Unix without running "configure"</i> &rarr; if you prefer to avoid running configure, you
can also use: <b>make -f Makefile.classic</b>.  You may want to make minor
edits to Makefile.classic to configure the build for your system.

<li><p><i>Msys/MinGW</i> &rarr; Use the
mingw makefile: "<b>make -f win/Makefile.mingw</b>"

<li><p><i>VC++</i> &rarr; Use the msc makefile.  First
change to the "win/" subdirectory ("<b>cd win</b>") then run
"<b>nmake /f Makefile.msc</b>".
</ol>
</ol>

<p>Note that Fossil requires the "zlib" compression library.  This library
is available by default on most unix systems, but it will typically have to
be installed separately on windows systems.  For windows builds, you may
need to edit the makefile to tell it exactly where zlib is located on your
system.</p>

<h2>3.0 Installing</h2>

<ol>
<li value="9">
<p>The finished binary is named "fossil" (or "fossil.exe" on windows).  
Put this binary in a 
directory that is somewhere on your PATH environment variable.
It does not matter where.</p>

<li>
<p><b>(Optional:)</b>
To uninstall, just delete the binary.</p>
</ol>

<h2>4.0 Additional Considerations</h2>

</nowiki>
  *  If the makefiles that come with Fossil do not work for
     you, or for some other reason you want to know how to build
     Fossil manually, then refer to the
     [./makefile.wiki | Fossil Build Process] document which describes
     in detail what the makefiles do behind the scenes.
