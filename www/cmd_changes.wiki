<h2>changes</h2>

The <code>changes</code> command is informational, it doesn't do
anything to a checked-out project, but it tells you something about
it.

This is simply a quick way to get a list of the files which are
different in the source tree (the checkout) and the repository.

There is a bit more information (was a file edited, added or
removed?, for instance).

The same information will be displayed if you
[./cmd_status.wiki | <code>&nbsp;fossil&nbsp;status&nbsp;</code>],
except there will be some additional repository information displayed
first.
