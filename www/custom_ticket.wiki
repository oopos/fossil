<title>Customizing The Ticket System</title>
<nowiki>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This guide will explain how to add the "assigned_to" and "submitted_by" fields
to the ticket system in Fossil, as well as making the system more useful.  You
must have "admin" access to the repository to implement these instructions.
</p>

<h2>First modify the TICKET table</h2><blockquote>
<p>
Click on the "Admin" menu, then "Tickets", then "Table".  After the other fields
and before the final ")", insert:
<pre>
  ,
  assigned_to TEXT,
  opened_by TEXT
</pre>
And "Apply Changes".  You have just added two more fields to the ticket
database!  NOTE: I won't tell you to "Apply Changes" after each step from here
on out.  Now, how do you use these fields?
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Next add assignees</h2><blockquote>
<p>
Back to the "Tickets" admin page, and click "Common".  Add something like this:
<pre>
set assigned_choices {
  unassigned
  tom
  dick
  harriet
}
</pre>
Obviously, choose names corresponding to the logins on your system.  The
'unassigned' entry is important, as it prevents you from having a NULL in that
field (which causes problems later when editing).
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Now modify the 'new ticket' page</h2><blockquote>
<p>
Back to the "Tickets" admin page, and click "New Ticket Page".  This is a little
more tricky.  Edit the top part:
<pre>
  if {[info exists submit]} {
     set status Open
     set opened_by $login
	 set assigned_to "unassigned"
     submit_ticket
  }
</pre>
Note the "set opened_by" bit -- that will automatically set the "opened_by"
field to the login name of the bug reporter.  Now, skip to the part with "EMail"
and modify it like so:
<pre>
&lt;th1>enable_output [expr { "$login" eq "anonymous"}]&lt;/th1>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td align="right">EMail:
&lt;input type="text" name="private_contact" value="$&lt;private_contact>" size="30">
&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;u>Not publicly visible&lt;/u>. Used by developers to contact you with
questions.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;th1>enable_output 1&lt;/th1>
</pre>
This bit of code will get rid of the "email" field entry for logged-in users.
Since we know the user's information, we don't have to ask for it. NOTE: it
might be good to automatically scoop up the user's email and put it here. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Modify the 'view ticket' page</h2><blockquote>
<p>
Look for the text "Contact:" (about halfway through).  Then insert these lines
after the closing tr tag and before the "enable_output" line:
<pre>
<tr>
  &lt;td align="right">Assigned to:&lt;/td>&lt;td bgcolor="#d0d0d0">
  $&lt;assigned_to>
  &lt;/td>
  &lt;td align="right">Opened by:&lt;/td>&lt;td bgcolor="#d0d0d0">
  $&lt;opened_by>
  &lt;/td>
</pre>
This will add a row which displays these two fields, in the event the user has
"edit" capability.  
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Modify the 'edit ticket' page</h2><blockquote>
<p>
Before the "Severity:" line, add this:
<pre>
&lt;tr>&lt;td align="right">Assigned to:&lt;/td>&lt;td>
&lt;th1>combobox assigned_to $assigned_choices 1&lt;/th1>
&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>
</pre>
That will give you a drop-down list of assignees.  Now, similar to the previous
section, look for "Contact:" and add this:
<pre>
  &lt;tr>&lt;td align="right">Reported by:&lt;/td>&lt;td>
  &lt;input type="text" name="opened_by" size="40"
   value="$&lt;opened_by>">
  &lt;/td>&lt;/tr>
</pre>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What next?</h2><blockquote>
<p>
Now you can add custom reports which select based on the person to whom the
ticket is assigned.  For example, an "Assigned to me" report could be:
<pre>
SELECT
  CASE WHEN status IN ('Open','Verified') THEN '#f2dcdc'
       WHEN status='Review' THEN '#e8e8e8'
       WHEN status='Fixed' THEN '#cfe8bd'
       WHEN status='Tested' THEN '#bde5d6'
       WHEN status='Deferred' THEN '#cacae5'
       ELSE '#c8c8c8' END AS 'bgcolor',
  substr(tkt_uuid,1,10) AS '#',
  datetime(tkt_mtime) AS 'mtime',
  type,
  status,
  subsystem,
  title
FROM ticket
WHERE assigned_to=user()
</pre>
</p>
</blockquote>
