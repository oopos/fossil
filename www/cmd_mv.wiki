<h2>mv | rename</h2>

The <code>mv</code> (alias "<code>rename</code>") command tells
<b>fossil</b> that a file has gone from one external name to another
without changing content.

You could do this by renaming the file in the file system,
[./cmd_rm.wiki | deleting] the old name from the project, and
[./cmd_add.wiki | adding] the new name.  But you would lose the
continuity of the <u>content's</u> history that way.  Using
<code>mv</code> makes the name change a part of the history
maintained by <b>fossil</b>.  You will, of course, need a good
comment somewhere (say, the commit comment) if you want to
remember <em>why</em> you changed the name...  <b>fossil</b>
only maintains history, it doesn't (yet) explain it.

<code>mv</code> is much like the [./cmd_rm.wiki | <code>rm</code>]
command, in that it manipulates <b>fossil</b>'s "idea" of what is
part of the project.  The difference is that <code>mv</code> assumes
you have actually made some change to the file system.
