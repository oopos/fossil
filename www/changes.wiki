  *  Harden the CGI processing logic against DOS attacks

  *  Change the "ssh:" transfer method to allow all access regardless of
     user permission.
  *  Improvements to the timeline messages associated with tag changes.
     (Requires a "[/help/rebuild | fossil rebuild]" to take effect.)

  *  Automatically enable hyperlinks if the UserAgent string in the 
     HTTP header suggests that the requestor is a human and not a bot.
  *  Show only commonly used commands with "fossil help".  Use
     "fossil help --all" to see the complete list now.
  *  Improvements to the "stash" command:  (1) Stash all files, not just 
     those below the working directory. (2) Add the --detail option to 
     "list". (3) Confirm before "drop --all". (4) Add the "help" 
     subcommand.
  *  Add an Admin/Access setting to change the number of octets of the

     to be changed to zero

     TCL interpreter to augment TH1.
  *  Merged the JSON branch into trunk.  Disabled by default.  Enabled

     in some future release.
