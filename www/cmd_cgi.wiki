<h2>cgi</h2>

<code>cgi</code> is the command that tells fossil it is running as a
web-page supplier for an external http server.  (For you web-miesters,
the "cgi" is actually unnecessary if your web environment is set up in
a normal fashion.)

This is the command you will probably use if you want to make a
moderate-to-high hit rate public repository (like the <b>fossil</b>
project's self-hosted repository) but you'll be using it in the
shebang line.

If you need lower level access to the pages <b>fossil</b> generates,
you'll want to look at the [./cmd_http.wiki | <code>http</code>]
command.
